SCons Cookbook
==============

If you want some help building a project with the the ``SCons``
build system, this Cookbook presents some recipes for getting
various tasks done.  The audience is programmers who already know a
bit about the build system - for learning ``SCons``, the `User Guide
<https://scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user/index.html>`_ is a
good starting point.

The snippets are are generally presented with little or no explanation,
rather they're expected to be "oh, that's how you could do that".
While they are usually trimmed down to the simplest possible form,
it is hopeful they will show the path to more complex scenarios.

If you would like to contribute to the Cookbook, it lives in
its own project on GitHub, where you can submit
`Issues and Bug Reports <https://github.com/SCons/cookbook/issues>`_
and `Pull Requests <https://github.com/SCons/cookbook/pulls>`_.
All suggestions will be carefully considered.
